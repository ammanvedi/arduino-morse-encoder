# arduino-morse-encoder

an arduino program to convert a string into morse code

## operation

the code alternates between two led's (one at pin 7, and one ay pin 12) these can be changed by changing
the "led" and "led2" variables.

the led assigned to "led" will blink to indicate a "dot"
the led assigned to "led2" will blink to indicate a "dash"

the pulse frequency can be changed by altering the "dotdelay" variable.

string to be sent is saved in the "data" variable
